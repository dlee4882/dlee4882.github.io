                <p>Autonomous vehicles are becoming an emerging technological advancement with plenty of potential. Although it is still an area that needs to be constantly tested and experimented upon, within the context of delivery there are multiple concepts and ideas that have been trialled by different companies. Examples such as the DRU (Domino’s Robotic Unit) for autonomous pizza delivery on ground and Amazon Prime Air for small parcel delivery using autonomous drones are some vehicles that have been tested. Google is also constantly extending limits of our AV technology and more than half a million miles of autonomous driving were logged on public roads (Anderson et. al, 2014). There are currently no common uses of autonomous vehicles in regular home delivery, but there definitely is technology out there waiting to be refined and innovated upon.</p>

            <div class="row">
              <div class="col-md-12">
                <p>For this brief we looked at areas within the delivery service that could be used by an autonomous vehicle. At first this was enclosed to an ‘apartment-people’ context but realised that a broader context of deliveries gives more insightful information for contextualising an autonomous vehicle within the experience.</p>
                <p>My group decided to use one particular research method in addition to a few compulsory interviews in order to gather a wide range of qualitative data. This would allow us to cone to better conclusions and more accurate analysis which would propel our designs later in the stage.</p>
                <p>I decided to release an online questionnaire up to social media in order to attract many frequent internet users. Sending and sharing the questionnaire through social media would allow my group to better attract our target audience – Online shoppers who live in apartments.</p>
                <p>In terms of constructing the questionnaire, I split my questions into 3 different categories:<p>
                <p>1.  The demographic of those who responded<p>
                <p>2.  Context of the delivery that they make<p>
                <p>3.  Their experience of the delivery<p>
                <p>This allows me to dive deep into the analysis and figure out what the core problem and user needs are in a certain context.</p>
                <h5>Demographic</h5>
                <p>The first section of the questionnaire was focusing on identifying the context. For this particular questionnaire, it was sent out through social media on different groups and pages, and received 37 responses. Most respondents were within the 18~25 age range, and almost 3 in 4 respondents have at least once lived in an apartment. Just over 85% of the respondents have requested a delivery directly to their premise. Looking at this data, I know that the following answers will be highly based on students or workers and also those who use the social media platform frequently (as this questionnaire was mostly sent out through social media platforms).</p>
                <h5>Context</h5>
                <p>Only about a third of the respondents preferred being at the premise, with a mixed preference in having it in front of their premise and picking it up from the post office. 86.5% of the respondents have ordered smaller parcels, with larger services and foods (such as uber eats) stood far below the 50% mark.</p>
                <p>12 of 13 respondents who checked foods/groceries also ordered smaller parcels. In fact, those who have had food delivered to their premise had an extremely high chance that they have experience with other delivery services. In addition, those who order larger services also have a 90% chance of having smaller parcel delivery experience. We can discern through this data that people prefer ordering smaller parcels and those that have ordered different services and food have experience with delivery in the first place.</p>
                <h5>Experience</h5>
                <p>Surprisingly, when taking the questionnaire, more people responded to being satisfied with delivery services at the moment. 59.5% of the respondents agreed to having no problems, with problematic deliverymen issues at 40.5% and the parcel never arriving at 21.6%. This means that delivery services aren’t necessarily the main issue, but something more ection of the context.</p>
                <p>This section of the data further proves that delivery services are actually not an issue, but is within a particularly different situaltion. The final question asked welcomed feedback for delivery services. From these responses, the most common ones were those that seeked refined tracking, being notified and less of one’s time and money gone into paying for the delivery or picking it up.</p>
                <h5>Affinity Diagramming</h5>
                <p>Gathering emotional and suggestive phrases from both the Interview and the Questionnaires, I organised into specific themes in the form of “I want to” which give phrase groups a certain goal or aim for the design solution.</p>
                <p>Then when those are grouped or further elaborated upon, we receive certain features or elements extended from the ‘wants’ that needs to be achieved during the design phase.</p>
                <p>These were the final user needs:</p>
                <p> 1. An efficient and convenient pick-up method</p>
                <p> 2. A remote confirmation and notification service</p>
                <p> 3. A necessity to save time for when time is needed the most</p>
                <p> 4. A safe, reliable and secure experience</p>
                <p> 5. And in terms of Drones:</p>
                <p> 6. Refined technology away from Human Error</p>

                <h4>User Research and Design</h4>
                <p>The entire User Research and Design phase went through two main trials of user research and more than 3 different iterations, allowing us to constantly refine our wireframes all the way from a low-fidelity mock-up to interactive, high-fidelity screens.</p>
                <p>We first gathered all our data from Affinity Diagramming and made one bigger affinity diagram, in which we extracted more specific user needs. We then took these points and created one single sentence which will be at the heart of our entire design process.</p>

                <h4><i>"How might we create an apartment delivery experience that is reassuring and convenient for apartment residents?"</i></h4>

                <p>We immediately went into brainstorming actual solutions that utilise autonomous vehicles – even ideas that didn’t seem plausible at times or ideas that required the entire apartment infrastructure to change to adapt to the delivery process. From the multiple we had, we chose the 3 most plausible solutions based on how effective it responds to our user needs and came up with a storyboard for each. This would allow us to focus down on the practical use of each design solution and truly determine how effective they would be to respond to our user needs.</p>

              <div class="col-md-12">
                <p>Concepts that involve changing the infrastructure of apartments:</p>
                <p>1. Having a personal chute or “mailbox” in each apartment where the drone can drop a parcel off</p>
                <p>Having a common drone delivery area in each apartment block that handles all parcel deliveries (think a post office service in an apartment)</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>Concepts that assume autonomous drones operating with existing apartment infrastructure:</p>
                <p>Having a delivery drone arrive at a time specified by the user where they have the option of collecting it from the drone on the balcony or at another agreed upon location at the apartment complex</p>

            <div class="row">
              <div class="col-md-12">
                <p>After presenting all the ideas, we discussed how each one solves different problems and how it tackles the main delivery problem in apartments. It became apparent that there were numerous difficulties with the ideas involving the infrastructure of apartments. So we decided to choose the concept that assumed we had autonomous drone technology already operating with the existing apartment infrastructure as we know it. Once the idea was chosen, and expanded in discussion, we sketched wireframes and constructed paper prototypes until we had one that would be clear enough for a usability test. For this we had to consider the information architecture and think about each screen this app would need to go through in order to secure a delivery.</p>

                <h4>User Testing</h4>
                <p>Our aim in the first round of testing was to explore which of our concepts provided a more intuitive user experience. Concept 1 & 2 were differentiated by the location in which we wanted users to provide their exact delivery location. Concept 1 involved placing this event before the commencement of payment i.e. while the user was still on an ecommerce platform and ordering their product. Concept 2 on the other hand envisioned that this would take place later once the parcel had been ordered and as the user was setting up the drone delivery app.</p>
                <p>The Evaluation methods that we employed for our first round of User Testing was Usability testing in conjunction with the Think-Aloud Protocol. Our low-fidelity user test consisted of basic introductory questions for context, then an open, think-aloud protocol method to achieving basic tasks, then finally ending with post-experience questions. We plan to do this with 5 different users, with the general concept of the drone delivery app explained to the user in the beginning. We had 3 users test User Flow 1 before 2, and 2 others vice versa. This was to compare the effectiveness of choosing apartment-specific location options before downloading the app to choosing the options in the app. Participants ranged from close to mutual community group members, prioritising the latter to reduce bias. Their ages ranged from 18~27, and potential candidates were asked either through social media or by physically meeting up until 5 candidates agreed, which we then set a time for the testing.</p>

                <h4>Analysis</h4>

                <p>For our second prototype, we had to improve the fidelity of the prototype, as well as make design decisions based on the responses and data received from the first user test. Our focus was on the usability and intuitive nature of each screen and the UI elements and patterns that the user encountered. For example, in the first test we were concerned especially with the big picture flow and when we should get the user to select the delivery location. Here we wanted to focus on their experience of actively selecting the delivery location for example and make sure this experience was coherent and simple.</p>

                <h4>Solving problems with the First Test</h4>
                <p>Since I’m the main test host, It’s my responsibility to collect participants, record data and report to my group. Due to this responsibility, I felt the need to discuss my own test hosting methods with my group to maximise the effectiveness and efficiency of testing. I first commented on the specific way I conducted each user test, and what I felt was good and bad based on the quality of the participants’ responses. I considered our pre and post questions, the quality of the prototype, as well as the location or environment in which the user was to do the test in. Through the discussion, we brainstormed and came up with a more constructed and detailed interview method which broke down each screen as a response opportunity for participants. We wanted to keep introductory questions as it is essential to give context to the demographic of the participants. Post questions were reviewed to be broader, and this time we decided to add a little more pre-experience question to get the participants engaged in our research. Participants will be chosen in the same manner as the first user test.</p>
              </div>
            </div>

            <div class="row">
              <div class="col-md-12">
                <h4>User Testing</h4>
                <p>Like I said above, the first round of user testing didn’t have the best quality of think-aloud method practice conducted. We wanted more active verbalising of their thoughts and utilised the more longer, constructed interview. </p>
                <p>We built a template which outlines each screen, and questions based on each screen. During each screen I had to ask: “How do you feel about this page?” and “Is there anything you like or dislike? Why?”. When conducting the actual interview, I found these questions more and more important due to two things:</p>
                <h5>1. Actively engages the participant with each screen, and they seem to constantly look for things to say.</h5>
                <p>Things they notice instantly are brought up quickly, whereas when they aren’t focusing, they are trying to bring themselves back to the screen and see what has value and what doesn’t. This in return gives us a clearer data of specific design elements that we can improve on.</p>
                <h5>2. Passively brings more and more understanding of the scope of our prototype to the participants</h5>
                <p>By committing to lengthier interviews, some participants were finding the impact of the flow that was given to them and were more prone to expressing concerns as they neared the last half of the screens. </p>

                <p>In addition, user testing environment was controlled to be in a more quiet place with a lot more space. For my final participants I tested a think-aloud protocol with two people both giving feedback, and realised that if they have a good relationship with each other, ideas constantly bounce off one another with better feedback, but at the same time hardly any feedback will be given in a few sections.<p>
              </div>
            </div>

            <div class="row">
              <div class="col-md-12">
                <h4>Analysis</h4>
                <p>Once all the data was confirmed, synthesised and analysed, I oversaw extracting key points and data necessary to progress our iterative design process. Some key findings from the analysis (personally) included how critical people were taking the test. Because we had high(er)-fidelity wireframes, the User Interface elements were a lot more clearer (or less clearer – which is typically what participants point out) for participants to assess. Compared to the previous testing, smaller details and chunks of the flow were criticised, and when participants gave out arguments, their points were much clearer. Overall the mid-fidelity prototype wireframes gave a lot more qualitative insight to some specific design methods and elements, as well as suggestions on adjusting the information architecture a little clearer and more convenient.</p>

                <h4>Results and Minor Synthesis</h4>
                <h5>Condense the process</h5>
                <h6><i>“there are too many steps just to get one feedback”</i></h6>
                <h6><i>“I feel like there’s too many unnecessary steps.”</i></h6>
                <p>Users found multiple issues with the extensive process of setting up the drone delivery. The main issue was the quantity of the screens, which created confusion, especially with some repetitive information. Users suggested removing the confirm/next button to automatically move to the next screen, make a single scrolling page, or even a proper progress bar. The prototype didn’t consider the understanding of a user and overloaded multiple screens with the same information (invoice, summary e.g.).</p>

                <h5>Adding better security and privacy</h5>
                <h6><i>“I wouldn’t like a camera going inwards because I would find that semi-invasive.”</i></h6>
                <h6><i>“It would be cool if there was a camera attached and I would like to see a live streaming.”</i></h6>
                <p>A common issue between users was that most had already assumed that they still needed to be at the location of the delivery to pick the parcel up at the right time, whereas the option to sign off remotely should play a significant part of our app/service. Users suggested options such as QR code or face recognition in response to this thought, but a more highly valued idea included the implementation of a live camera feed which a user can access through their devices from the drone. On the other hand, the detailed delivery set up (the specific apartment/balcony) was suggested to be ‘”creepy” by 3 in 5 users. One participant went as far as not wanting a live camera feed as it may be “semi-invasive”.</p>

                <h5>Better way to sign off</h5>
                <h6><i>“I’m very confused. Maybe I should sign off after it leaves? I thought I signed off already.”</i></h6>
                <p>There was some confusion with the signing off process experienced by most users. Participants questioned the signing off process due to the repetition of the summary and its confirmation buttons in multiple screens. 2 in 5 participants suggested that the Landing, Sign off and Leaving pages were ineffective for reasons such as confirming the sign off too much, and its size which prevents a person from multi-tasking on their phones. In addition, some participants were more worried about the process at the Landing than the Sign off itself, suggesting countdowns and camera feeds.</p>

                <h4>Finalising the Design</h4>
                <p>Although I didn’t work nearly as much on the actual design of the high-fidelity prototypes (I will explain why soon), I still knew the direction that my other group members were going to go with the wireframes due to the amount of transparent discussions we’ve had in the past. In the end, I would be responsible for more animation and video aspects of the entire process (and assignment process). Both my team members’ strengths were in wireframing and prototyping, whereas those were my weaknesses. Conversely, I had a major strength in animation and digital media production, which meant that some animations, UI transitions and the video walkthrough could be done stress free for my group. </p>

                <p>I want to talk about this in the Synthesis as the core of what I did. Since we had a video walkthrough due, we thought it was a good opportunity to really show the higher-fidelity of our work. Explaining transitions and visualising real-life processes with screen animations were done by directly reflecting and responding to some key points made by participants in the last user test. The core of the problem really lied in the second-half (the app-half) of the process, so I responded accordingly. </p>

                <p>Autonomous vehicles are becoming an emerging technological advancement with plenty of potential. Although it is still an area that needs to be constantly tested and experimented upon, within the context of delivery there are multiple concepts and ideas that have been trialled by different companies. Examples such as the DRU (Domino’s Robotic Unit) for autonomous pizza delivery on ground and Amazon Prime Air for small parcel delivery using autonomous drones are some vehicles that have been tested. Google is also constantly extending limits of our AV technology and more than half a million miles of autonomous driving were logged on public roads (Anderson et. al, 2014). There are currently no common uses of autonomous vehicles in regular home delivery, but there definitely is technology out there waiting to be refined and innovated upon.</p>
